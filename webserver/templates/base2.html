{# ``base.html`` is the template all our other templates derive from. While
    Flask-Bootstrap ships with its own base, it is good form to create a custom
    one for our app, as it allows customizing some aspects.
  
    Deriving from bootstap/base.html gives us a basic page scaffolding.

  {# Then, inside the head block, we apply these. To not replace the header,
    ``super()`` is used: #}
  {% block head %}
  {{super()}}

    http://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Bootstrap/basic-usage.html#available-blocks

     {{super()}}  {# do not forget to call super or Bootstrap's own stylesheets
